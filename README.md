# BacktoBO
To encourage to appreciate Bologna and make a tour of the streets of the centre more attractive, can be interesting an application that uses augmented reality to travel back in time, enriching the experience of the visitor allowing to compare the old photographs with the current state of the same spot. 
The intention is to make available a new way of visiting the city, using the technologies that surround us and that we use daily as a mobile phone.
The project will be developed through an application that guides the user across the streets of Bologna using the map showing a recommended route created specifically for the project and highlights the places of interest. It will allow the user to immerse himself in the Bologna of the past.
The application provides the exact location of the historical photo of Bologna on the map. The visitor can use the device as an ideal screen for augmented reality, to make comparisons between the historical photo and the present.
Furthermore, next to the images that appear on the screen will be provided more details on the history of the streets and old shops present.
Seeing  the present and the past at the same time offers the possibility to reflect, in an innovative way, on how the city has changed.
